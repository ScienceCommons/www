Getting started
===============

- Install [node](http://nodejs.org/download/).

- Ensure that you have grunt and grunt cli installed globally

    sudo npm install -g grunt grunt-cli

- Then

    npm install
    grunt serve

Presently there is no server component.  connect presently serves the assets.
Down the road we will need an actual server so we can handle user registration/authorization
